# Restaurant
##  Demo:  https://restaurant-website-basic.netlify.app/

## Description:
<hr>
This Website is a classic Website for a Restaurant. I found that on Youtube, there was a Figma Link so I tried to reproduce it.

For this app, I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React Js

## Why create this app ?
<hr>
As a new and novice front end web developer, I practice my skills everyday. I wanted to test myself so I reproduce this website and added some features, like the Sign in and Booking popup.
I also used React Reveal for the first time, and I found it pretty useful.

## What kind of improvement can you add ?
<hr>
Here's the possible improvement I would like to make:<br>
<br>
- Animate the sign in with an sliding window in order to sign up
